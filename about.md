# About This Site

This blog is meant to provide me with a semi-permanent place to share at length my thoughts on matters related to computing, mathematics and the sciences. 

Except where I'm explicitly quoting someone else, everything written on this site is of my own composition, and written to convey my own thoughts only. Nothing I write will have been paid for or created to promote some business or service. 

Finally, everything I write on here will have been by my own hand, without any AI assistance. The way I see it, if I want what I put up on here to be worth reading by human eyes, it ought to be worth taking the time for human hands to write. Besides, AI-generated writing tends to have a smoothed-out quality that stifles individuality, and I'm just vain enough to want my own particular style to come across to whoever bothers to read this, whatever stylistic deficits I expose thereby. 

## Why a Blog on GitHub?
The primary motivation behind deciding on a blog, rather than sticking with the usual social-media outlets, is that I wanted to be able to write at length about things I personally find interesting, and to go into as much detail as might take my fancy. If that means going crazy laying out equations using LaTeX  and drawing up graphs in TikZ, I should be free to do so to the extent permitted my own capabilities allow. That means having a level of control over the layout of the site that places like Medium don't cater for. 

Going with an old-fashioned blog also makes it easy to share simple, human-readable links to individual articles. That it spares any potential readers the chore of infinite-scrolling and the distractions of "likes", "reactions" and all the rest is just icing on the cake.
