# About This Site

This blog is meant to provide me with a semi-permanent place to share at length my thoughts on matters related to computing, mathematics and the sciences.

## Why a Blog on GitHub?
The primary motivation behind deciding on a blog, rather than sticking with the usual social-media outlets, is that I wanted to be able to write at length about things I personally find interesting, and to go into as much detail as might take my fancy. If that means going crazy laying out equations using LaTeX  and drawing up graphs in TikZ, I should be free to do so to the extent permitted my own capabilities allow. That means having a level of control over the layout of the site that places like Medium don't cater for. 

Going with an old-fashioned blog also makes it easy to share simple, human-readable links to individual articles. That it spares any potential readers the chore of infinite-scrolling and the distractions of "likes", "reactions" and all the rest is just icing on the cake.
