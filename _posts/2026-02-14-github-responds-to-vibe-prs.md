Just a day after [writing about](https://alapite.github.io/programming/2026/02/13/open-source-and-cheap-code.html) 
the matplotlib Clawdbot incident, I happened to run into 
[this GitHub article](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/welcome-to-the-eternal-september-of-open-source-heres-what-we-plan-to-do-for-maintainers/)
about what they're planning to do to alleviate the plight of open-source maintainers 
who are being inundated with autogenerated pull-requests. 

While the whole thing is worth a read, to
see the various approaches being considered by different groups, one thing that stood out to me is
the mention of the Linux kernel [already using](https://lwn.net/Articles/798230/) a "web of trust" 
approach of the sort I suggested. While the features GitHub has shipped (or will soon ship) should
help a bit with the noise, I don't see that there's really any other option than for the 
"web of trust" model to become the standard way of doing things. It's either that, or a 
mass migration to the ["invitation-only"](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
stance that Ghostty has already adopted.
