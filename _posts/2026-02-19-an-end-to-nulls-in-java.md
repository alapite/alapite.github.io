Anyone who's ever had to deal with null pointers in languages like C, Go and Java will heartily agree with Tony Hoare's calling null-references a [Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/). If anything, a mere billion Dollars understates the true cumulative cost of null references by at least two orders of magnitude, as they are probably the second-biggest source of security breaches (right behind the lack of proper array bounds-checking in C and C++). 

One of the reasons why I was so enthusiastic about pure functional programming from the very start was because they seemed to offer a principled, systamtic way of ameliorating this issue, namely through the use of the [Maybe](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/Maybe) datatype. Java did eventually introduce the Optional type, but the implementation's [limitations](https://www.baeldung.com/java-monads-optional) [prevented](https://mccue.dev/pages//4-5-25-optional-critique) it from fully realising the promises it initially seemed to offer. The only way to ensure systematic use of the Maybe type on the JVM seemed to be to adopt Scala, whose [Option](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/option-type) type correctly abided by the Monadic laws, and could therefore be used systematically within an effect-system like [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/). 

Java developers have tried to minimise this issue through techniques like using `@Nullable` annotations, but even with such modest efforts, the lack of sustained official support has [severely weakened](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/15d1dkd/why_was_jsr305_nullable_annotation_abandoned/) adoption, with [multiple third-party options](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4963300/which-notnull-java-annotation-should-i-use) competing for attention. Even now, so many years on, [Spring](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-null-safety-annotations) and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotating-source-code.html) both offer their own takes on the approach, as does the widely used [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/NonNull) library.

Over a decade ago, I was able to attend a talk on Java by official Oracle representatives in which they provided an update on the intended future course of the language. Much was made during the course of this talk about making Java more "functional", and so, after the talk was over, and the floor was opened to questions, I had the opportunity to question the Oracle reps about this very issue, pointing out how the `Optional` type fell short. The reply I received at the time was that I shouldn't hold my breath expecting Java to go down the Scala route by copying features like Scala's `val` (which guarantees reference immutability) or a fully monadic successor to `java.util.Optional`. 

This response seemed to me to make a mockery of all the prior talk about a more "functional" Java, and it led me to feel that while the JVM certainly had a long life ahead of it yet, "Java the language" was likely going to become a relic, increasingly bypassed in favour of more innovative alternatives like Kotlin and Scala. Things haven't quite turned out as I imagined at the time, but less due to a change of approach with Java than to the missteps of would-be-successors like Scala (as I have [described at length](https://alapite.github.io/programming/2026/01/27/functional-programming-in-the-llm-age.html)).

It's with all of preceding in mind that I took such pleasure in learning about [this JEP draft](https://openjdk.org/jeps/8303099) indicating that the Java language maintainers are finally taking a serious look into the whole null-pointer problem. Granted, it's highly unlikely that this will result in anything concrete for several more years, given the JEP's dependencies on [other](https://openjdk.org/jeps/401) bits of work which are themselves still under development, and even then, it will probably take several more years to see widespread adoption, as companies wait for one or more LTS releases before migrating, but better late than never I suppose.
