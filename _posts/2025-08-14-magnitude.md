## In the beginning ...
Back in the [Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic) ("Stone Age") era in which our earliest _Homo_ ancestors emerged, and in which they then spent 99% of their existence - well before the emergence of agriculture, cities, and all the rest they gave rise to - how important was it to be able to count things? It obviously would have been valuable to be able to keep track of, say, how many predators were seen loitering next to the local watering hole (in case, for example, one or more of them had broken off to try to encircle one's group), but beyond that, how much more numeracy would have been necessary?

The scientific literature [seems to suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sense_in_animals) that we humans owe our numerical abilities to traits we share in common with the rest of the primates. These traits are responsible for 
- our ability to judge the relative sizes of groups (useful in, for example, deciding whether to fight with or flee from a hostile group).
- a sense of **ordinality**, which is a fancy way of saying we can tell whether values are in an incremental order (e.g. when a collection of numbers have been sorted). 
- the ability to **subitize** - a technical term denoting our ability to recognise how many there are of a small number of objects without having to explicitly count them. Most people have the ability to do this for 1 to 3 objects, and apparently so do many other primates.

## Enter Homo sapiens
It's possible that the aforementioned abilities were sufficient for most of the ~ 2.7 million years since the appearance of the genus _Homo_, but by the time _Homo sapiens_ began to emerge around 300,000 years ago, more elaborate numerical skills would have been needed to carry out the more sophisticated subsistence strategies that were the hallmark of our specie. Knowing how many days there are in a typical lunar month would have been useful in many contexts (e.g. judging when to go to a coastal area to beach-comb at low tide). In a similar vein, knowing how many lunar months there are in a year would have been helpful in keeping track of seasonal prey migrations, in recognising when particular fruits, herbs and tubers would be in season, understanding which water sources would probably be worth visiting, and many other such use cases. 

In all of these scenarios, being able to keep track of values up to the 30-40 would probably have sufficed, and beyond that perhaps a single marker value indicating little more than _"too numerous to count"_ (even if phrased in poetic terms like _"as numerous as the stars in the sky"_ and so on). That there are approximately 365 days in a year is not much of a challenge to this position, as I believe the ability to handle cognitive complexity through "chunking" had emerged even before our own species did. I think the [emergence of compound tools](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/College_of_the_Canyons/Anthro_101%3A_Physical_Anthropology/11%3A_Genus_Homo_and_Homo_sapiens/11.1%3A_Homo_heidelbergensis) some 600,000 years ago is strong evidence in support of that position; making such tools requires the ability to **simultaneously** see the tools as their constituent parts **and** as the sum of those parts. A mind capable of doing this would have had no problem seeing a year as consisting of 12 months, while also understanding that an individual (lunar) month would have 28 days.  

## Agriculture changes everything
While hunter-gatherers would probably not have required any more numeracy than I've indicated above, things changed with the invention of agriculture, and with it, the emergence of fixed settlements. It's unlikely things would have changed straightaway, when the first agricultural settlements were few, their inhabitants small in numbers, and the likelihood of their clashing with other groups (or of group members clashing with each other) remained low. However, one of the draws of agriculture was that it reduced the risks of subsisting, and the increased security in food supply made it possible for populations to grow at rates that would have been unimaginable for hunter-gatherers. As farming populations exploded in size, so did their demand for land and water, and, naturally, so did the need to clearly demarcate where one farmer's claims began and another's ended. But even at this point, most farming settlements could probably have gotten by with little more than agreements based on physical markers (e.g. _"my farm area ends where the local brook takes a sharp rightwards turn"_).

I believe what really began to change the need for numeracy was the growth of these small settlements into villages, and eventually, into the first cities. With cities came more hierarchical forms of social organisation, and in particular, rulers with the arms to demand that their farmer subjects yield to them as tribute ("taxes") a certain portion of the fruits of their labour in the fields. With so many subjects under their thumbs, how could these rulers keep track of just how much they ought to be collecting? How could they know which subjects were paying less than they ought to, especially when there said subjects might differ in how much land they farmed, and how additional farm labour they could call upon? How could they be sure that the underlings they'd deputised to collect all of that tribute weren't stealing some (or even all) of it for themselves?

## No taxation without numerical representation
I don't think it's an accident that the first forms of writing emerged in the first city states of the Middle East. In the city of Uruk, where some of the oldest cuneiform tablets have been found, their primary usage was [for accounting](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485) - to record quantities of jars, loaves of bread and the like. Indeed, only **after** cuneiform was created for such bureaucratic purposes did it gradually evolve into a system capable of representing more general ideas, an evolutionary process that took over 1,000 years to conclude.

The Uruk in which these cuneiform tablets emerged, with its several thousand inhabitants, would seem like little more than a village to modern eyes, but never before in human history had so many people lived so close to each other under the rule of a unified authority. Keeping track of so many people and all of their obligations would have required a grasp of magnitudes well beyond anything ever witnessed before. The early Sumerian cuneiform accountants proved themselves up to the task, inventing a system combining base 10 with base 60, and able to represent numbers as large as 216,000. 

Their Babylonian successors simplified this system, retaining only the base 60, but they also substantially [expanded on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mathematics), developing the first algebraic methods for solving quadratic equations, discovering how to model exponential growth (for the purpose of calculating interest on loans), and drawing up methods for calculating areas and volumes (using a rough approximation $\pi \approx 3$). Finally, the Babylonians were the first to make written records of [their astronomical observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy). These records would prove of enormous significance for the subsequent development of not just astronomy, but physics in general (more on which we save for another day). 

## The Greeks and their gifts
While the Greeks of classical antiquity (i.e. from about 600 BCE onwards) were heirs to what the Babylonians had achieved and the Egyptians subsequently refined, the contributions [made by Greek thinkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_mathematics) to this body of shared knowledge were truly revolutionary, introducing ideas about logic and proof that remain central to mathematics to this day. Readers interested in appreciating the colossal scope of the Greek contribution can consult the Wikipedia article I've linked to, but for the purpose of this article, we can restrict our attention to noting that these early Greeks were comfortable enough with handling large numbers to justify needing a name 100 million ($10^8$), a value far in excess of anything any bureaucrat would ever have needed for administrative purposes, especially in a world whose entire human population was probably still less than that value. Numbers as large as $10^{16}$ could easily be represented as squares of these smaller values (e.g. $$ 10^{16} = (10^8)^2 $$).   

Beyond this, Archimedes, in his work [The Sand Reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sand_Reckoner), attempted to estimate how many grains of sand could fit into the universe (as it was known at the time). Towards this end, Archimedes was driven to invent a new system to represent numbers, through which he was able to represent numbers as large as $$ 10^{8*10^{16}} $$. While it may not be obvious to anyone unfamiliar with exponential notation, this value is so gigantic that the most generous estimate for the number of particles in the observable universe (as currently understood) would not even be a rounding error next to it!        

## What the Roman didn't do for us
For all of the ancient Romans' strengths in administrating, engineering and soldiering, abstract thinking was **not** their fort√©, especially when divorced from all real world application. Apart from their creation of a "Pax Romana" which enabled the spread of Greek thought throughout the mediterranean, the primary impact of the Romans was their invention of an exceedingly [clumsy numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) which would cause headaches for many a literate European for the next 2 millennia.

## The Arabs and their numerals


Let's see how $ f_8(8) $ is displayed.

What about $ f_{\omega}(3) $ ?

Now let's try $ f_{\omega^{\omega}}(4) $.

So far so good. Now for $ f_{\varepsilon + 1}(3) $.

Here's an example of a Feferman-Schutte ordinal: $ f_{\Gamma}(3) $.
