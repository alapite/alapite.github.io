### In the beginning ...
Back in the [Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic) ("Stone Age") era in which our earliest _Homo_ ancestors emerged, and in which they then spent 99% of their existence - well before the emergence of agriculture, cities, and all the rest they gave rise to - how important was it to be able to count things? It obviously would have been valuable to be able to keep track of, say, how many predators were seen loitering next to the local watering hole (in case, for example, one or more of them had broken off to try to encircle one's group), but beyond that, how much more numeracy would have been necessary?

The scientific literature [seems to suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sense_in_animals) that we humans owe our numerical abilities to traits we share in common with the rest of the primates. These traits are responsible for 
- our ability to judge the relative sizes of groups (useful in, for example, deciding whether to fight with or flee from a hostile group).
- a sense of **ordinality**, which is a fancy way of saying we can tell whether values are in an incremental order (e.g. when a collection of numbers have been sorted). 
- the ability to **subitise** - a technical term denoting our ability to recognise how many there are of a small number of objects without having to explicitly count them. Most people have the ability to do this for 1 to 3 objects, and apparently so do many other primates.

### Enter Homo sapiens
It's possible that the aforementioned abilities were sufficient for most of the ~ 2.7 million years since the appearance of the genus _Homo_, but by the time _Homo sapiens_ began to emerge around 300,000 years ago, more elaborate numerical skills would have been needed to carry out the more sophisticated subsistence strategies that were the hallmark of our specie. Knowing how many days there are in a typical lunar month would have been useful in many contexts (e.g. judging when to go to a coastal area to beach-comb at low tide). In a similar vein, knowing how many lunar months there are in a year would have been helpful in keeping track of seasonal prey migrations, in recognising when particular fruits, herbs and tubers would be in season, understanding which water sources would probably be worth visiting, and many other such use cases. 

In all of these scenarios, being able to keep track of values up to the 30-40 would probably have sufficed, and beyond that perhaps a single marker value indicating little more than _"too numerous to count"_ (even if phrased in poetic terms like _"as numerous as the stars in the sky"_ and so on). That there are approximately 365 days in a year is not much of a challenge to this position, as I believe the ability to handle cognitive complexity through "chunking" had emerged even before our own species did. I think the [emergence of compound tools](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/College_of_the_Canyons/Anthro_101%3A_Physical_Anthropology/11%3A_Genus_Homo_and_Homo_sapiens/11.1%3A_Homo_heidelbergensis) some 600,000 years ago is strong evidence in support of that position; making such tools requires the ability to **simultaneously** see the tools as their constituent parts **and** as the sum of those parts. A mind capable of doing this would have had no problem seeing a year as consisting of 12 months, while also understanding that an individual (lunar) month would have 28 days.  

### Agriculture changes everything
While hunter-gatherers would probably not have required any more numeracy than I've indicated above, things changed with the invention of agriculture, and with it, the emergence of fixed settlements. It's unlikely things would have changed straightaway, when the first agricultural settlements were few, their inhabitants small in numbers, and the likelihood of their clashing with other groups (or of group members clashing with each other) remained low. However, one of the draws of agriculture was that it reduced the risks of subsisting, and the increased security in food supply made it possible for populations to grow at rates that would have been unimaginable for hunter-gatherers. As farming populations exploded in size, so did their demand for land and water, and, naturally, so did the need to clearly demarcate where one farmer's claims began and another's ended. But even at this point, most farming settlements could probably have gotten by with little more than agreements based on physical markers (e.g. _"my farm area ends where the local brook takes a sharp rightwards turn"_).

I believe what really began to change the need for numeracy was the growth of these small settlements into villages, and eventually, into the first cities. With cities came more hierarchical forms of social organisation, and in particular, rulers with the arms to demand that their farmer subjects yield to them as tribute ("taxes") a certain portion of the fruits of their labour in the fields. With so many subjects under their thumbs, how could these rulers keep track of just how much they ought to be collecting? How could they know which subjects were paying less than they ought to, especially when there said subjects might differ in how much land they farmed, and how additional farm labour they could call upon? How could they be sure that the underlings they'd deputised to collect all of that tribute weren't stealing some (or even all) of it for themselves?

## No taxation without numerical representation
I don't think it's an accident that the first forms of writing emerged in the first city states of the Middle East. In the city of Uruk, where some of the oldest cuneiform tablets have been found, their primary usage was [for accounting](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485) - to record quantities of jars, loaves of bread and the like. Indeed, only **after** cuneiform was created for such bureaucratic purposes did it gradually evolve into a system capable of representing more general ideas, an evolutionary process that took over 1,000 years to conclude.

The Uruk in which these cuneiform tablets emerged, with its several thousand inhabitants, would seem like little more than a village to modern eyes, but never before in human history had so many people lived so close to each other under the rule of a unified authority. Keeping track of so many people and all of their obligations would have required a grasp of magnitudes well beyond anything ever witnessed before. The early Sumerian cuneiform accountants proved themselves up to the task, inventing a system combining base 10 with base 60, and able to represent numbers as large as 216,000. 

Their Babylonian successors simplified this system, retaining only the base 60, but they also substantially [expanded on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mathematics), developing the first algebraic methods for solving quadratic equations, discovering how to model exponential growth (for the purpose of calculating interest on loans), and drawing up methods for calculating areas and volumes (using a rough approximation $\pi \approx 3$). Finally, the Babylonians were the first to make written records of [their astronomical observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy). These records would prove of enormous significance for the subsequent development of not just astronomy, but physics in general (more on which we save for another day). 

## The Greeks and their gifts
While the Greeks of classical antiquity (i.e. from about 600 BCE onwards) were heirs to what the Babylonians had achieved and the Egyptians subsequently refined, the contributions [made by Greek thinkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_mathematics) to this body of shared knowledge were truly revolutionary, introducing ideas about logic and proof that remain central to mathematics to this day. Readers interested in appreciating the colossal scope of the Greek contribution can consult the Wikipedia article I've linked to, but for the purpose of this article, we can restrict our attention to noting that these early Greeks were comfortable enough with handling large numbers to justify needing a name 100 million ($10^8$), a value far in excess of anything any bureaucrat would ever have needed for administrative purposes, especially in a world whose entire human population was probably still less than that value. Numbers as large as $10^{16}$ could easily be represented as squares of these smaller values, e.g. $$ 10^{16} = (10^8)^2 $$   

Beyond this, Archimedes, in his work [The Sand Reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sand_Reckoner), attempted to estimate how many grains of sand could fit into the universe (as it was known at the time). Towards this end, Archimedes was driven to invent a new system to represent numbers, through which he was able to represent numbers as large as $$ 10^{8*10^{16}} $$ 
While it may not be obvious to anyone unfamiliar with exponential notation, this value is so gigantic that the most generous estimate for the number of particles in the observable universe (as currently understood) would not even be a rounding error next to it!        

## What the Roman didn't do for us
For all of the ancient Romans' strengths in administrating, engineering and soldiering, abstract thinking was **not** their forté, especially when divorced from all real world application. Apart from their creation of a "Pax Romana" which enabled the spread of Greek thought throughout the mediterranean, the primary impact of the Romans was their invention of an exceedingly [clumsy numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) which would cause headaches for many a literate European for the next 2 millennia.

Amongst the many issues with Roman numerals are
 - The ambiguity in how digits are represented - while `I, II, III` (1, 2, 3), `IV, V, VI, VII, VIII` (4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and `IX, X, XI` (9, 10, 11) seem distinct enough in isolation, imagine trying to parse such representations when they are used in the context of several other digits (e.g. ` DCCLXXXIX`).
 - The inconsistency in how values are built up. With `I, II, III` the notion is **additive**, but then with `IV, V` it become **subtractive**. It then returns to additivity with `VI, VII, VIII` before becoming subtractive again with `IX, X`. This back-and-forth is then repeated for values like `XL` (40), `XC` (90), `CD` (400) and `CM` (900). One might expect the pattern to continue with values like 4,000 and 9,000, but evidently this is not the case.
 - The lack of any symbols to represent the concept of zero. It was not until the Middle Ages that scholars began to use the term "Nulla" to signify the absence of something.
 - The clumsiness of arithmetic operations. Take multiplication; an algorithm for carrying it out [does exist](https://rbutterworth.nfshost.com/Tables/romanmult/), but it is a far more tedious process than the standard one taught in elementary schools today. As for division, it seems the Romans made rarely use of the operation beyond halving, and on such rare occasions could rely on a method called [Egyptian division](https://www.themathdoctors.org/arithmetic-with-roman-numerals/). In practice, it seems that for most non-trivial arithmetic, the Romans relied on the [hand abacus](https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/how-did-the-romans-calculate/) to do the heavy lifting.
 - The inability to represent really large numbers. In [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Large_numbers), mention is made of the _"Apostrophus"_ and _"Vinculum"_ methods for handling large numbers, but neither system can handle values in the hundreds of millions, let alone in the billions (which now routinely occur in everyday discourse).   

## The Arabs and their numerals
Perhaps the most widely known fact about the Arabic numerals is that they are not an original Arabic invention, but are actually Hindu in origin, tracing their roots all the way back to the [Brahmi numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmi_numerals) in the 3rd century BCE. Still, even granting this much, the fact remains that it was through the system's widespread adoption in the Arab world that Europeans eventually came to learn about it, and through them in turn, the rest of the world. Arabic numerals were so tremendous a step forward that they have now swept aside older number systems even in cultures with thousands of years of their own traditions (e.g. China, Korea, Japan and all of South East Asia).

What makes Arabic numerals so powerful? At the core of their appeal is that they are a positional notation, which provides a systematic, easily comprehensible way to build ever larger numbers, using only a few digit forms. After mastering the ten digits from 0 to 9, all one has to do is understand is the order in which digits read from least to most significant (which is typically right to left). If you know how to build 10, `11, 12, ... 19`, then `20, 21, ... 29` is immediately obvious, as is the fact that `99` must be followed by `100`, `999` by `1000`, and so on ad infinitum. There are no weird exceptions to worry about, there are no surprising switches between additive and subtractive processes, there is no need to recruit new symbols upon reaching a certain value, etc.

As powerful as the Arabic numerical system is in its ordinary form, it can be made far more powerful still with just a small tweak. By the use of [Scientific Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation), one can succinctly represent values of such magnitude that the mind will struggle to truly comprehend. All that needs to change is to replace the explicit listing of all the digits of a value with a symbol representing the number of such digits, so that a value like `3,000,000` becomes $ 3 * 10^6 $, and instead of writing, for example, 8 billion as `8,745,000,000` we can simply say $ 8.745 * 10^9 $. 

To give an idea of just how powerful scientific notation is, 
- The United Nations estimated the entire world's GDP for 2024 at about `100,834,796,000,000` which is less than $ 1.001 * 10^{15} $. 
- The distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately $148 * 10^{9}$ meters. 
- The distance from Earth to Pluto is about $5.43 * 10^{12}$ meters. 
- The distance light travels in a year is ~ $9.4607 * 10^{15}$ meters. The distance from Earth to Proxima Centauri, the closest star outside our solar system, is 4.246 light years, or ~ $4.02 * 10^{16}$ meters.
- The [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) [^1] is estimated at 95 billion light years across, or less than $10^{16}$ meters. 
- The total mass of the observable universe is estimated at $1.5 x 10^{53}$ kg. The number of particles in it [is estimated](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/) at $3.28 x 10^{80}$. Even if that number were low by a factor of a trillion, that would still be well below $10^{100}$, which is the definition of a [Googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) (after which the company Google was named).

Using the same notation but going in the opposite direction,
1. The mass of a single proton is estimated at less than $2 * 10^{-27}$ kg.
2. The Planck length, below which the theory of general relativity is expected to fail, is about $1.62 x 10^{-35}$ meters. 

Scientific notation is so powerful that it can represent the ratio between the mass of the entire observable universe and the mass of a single proton compactly as less than $10^{80}$. And yet, as powerful as examples like this show scientific notation to be, they still do not provide a full picture of what this notation makes possible.

The important thing to note here is that the same trick by which scientific notation so succinctly represents huge numbers can be applied recursively. If a number like $10^{10}$ is permissible, then why not $10^{10^{10}}$? This extension of the notation introduces no problems as long as there is agreement the order in which values are to be evaluated. In keeping with standard practice with Arabic numerals, this is usually right to left, so given a number like $10^{20^{30}}$, the $20^{30}$ is evaluated first, with the resulting value then applied to the leftmost $10$ . This straightforward extension makes it possible to represent values like $10^{10^{120}}$ (an upper bound on how long it will take for the entire universe to cool down to absolute zero, according to some cosmological models).

Of course, having taken this recursive step to increase our notational power, nothing stops us from repeating it yet again, so we could have $10^{20^{30^{40}}}$ and so on ad infinitum. Using this approach, we can represent numbers [as large as](https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_time) the Poincaré recurrence time, an estimate of how long it would take for a [Boltzmann brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) to spontaneously form in a heat-dead universe. 

One quickly apparent roadblock to expanding on this approach is that it fares poorly with standard typesetting. Accommodating the nesting of numbers more than 2 levels requires rows to either become irregularly spaced, or, if uniform spacing is desired, so far apart that reading can become a chore. Imagine having to deal with a figure like $$ 2^{15^{11^{14^{16}}}} $$ within the confines of a book!

As it turns out, there are yet more powerful notational systems which get around this issue, even for values no one would dream of using any variation of scientific notation for.

## Beyond Arabic Numerals
As we've seen, scientific notation based on Arabic numerals is able to easily handle virtually all scenarios most of us are ever likely to encounter, whether in our personal or professional lives, and by "most" I'm including here most physicists, computer scientists and other such people, who might be expected to encounter extremes far beyond the run of ordinary human experience. The fact is that most physicists aren't cosmologists contemplating how long it will take all of the observable universe's black holes to evaporate.

Given the preceding, one might imagine that there's no need for even more powerful systems of notation, but that would be wrong. True as it may be that scientific notation suffices for almost all uses, there are still realms of thought in which it falls short. Take, for instance, the field of [computability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory), which seeks to address the question of what functions are computable even in principle, and for those which aren't, whether they can be placed in some hierarchy of how far away from being computable they are. 

One of the seminal discoveries in this field was the proof by Church and Turing that the so-called [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) is [undecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem): in plain English, this says that there can never be some general algorithm into which one can feed in any arbitrary program, and get in return a simple "yes/no" response to the question of whether the input program will ever halt.   

Even knowing that no such universal oracle exists, it is still meaningful to ask whether, given some class of programs of a bounded size, what the longest run-time is for that subset of the class which does halt. We aren't asking for some single miracle machine to tell us whether each of the members of the class will ever halt, we just want to know the upper-bound on the waiting time for those which do eventually grind to a stop. Finding out how big this value gets is the essence of the [Busy Beaver problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver).

With the Busy Beaver Problem, one usually works with a simple Turing machine which is allowed to have some number of states $n$. Let us denote here the length of the longest-running such machine as $BB(n)$. Then, the initial values of BB(n) are as follows:

- $BB(2) = 6$
- $BB(3) = 21$
- $BB(4) = 107$

So far, so reasonable. But then, things take a sudden turn:

- $BB(5) = 47,176,870$

$BB(6)$ is where we really run into trouble. An early bound for this was

- $BB(6) > 10^{10^{10^{3314360}}}$

but this has since been shown to be a very, very weak lower bound on the true value, and to even describe the most recent bound, we are forced to introduce a new way of writing numbers.

### Enter Knuth's Up-Arrow Notation

We saw earlier that the key to making scientific notation powerful enough to handle even the most far-flung scenarios imaginable by cosmologists was **recursion**. As it turns out, this is the very same ingredient which lies at the root of Knuth's [^2] [Up-Arrow Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation). 

THe basic idea underlying Knuth's up-arrow notation is to progressively build up ever more powerful operations for constructing numbers, starting from multiplication. Whole-number exponentiation can be regarded as repeated multiplication, so for example

$$ 3^3 = 3x3x3 $$

If we denote exponentiation using the $\uparrow$ symbol, then we can represent $3^3$ as $3 \uparrow 3$. While this change of notation doesn't buy us anything on its own, it does open the way to systematic repetition of the approach in a uniform manner.

As a step up from exponentation, we can consider the operation of **tetration**, which we define using the symbol $\uparrow\uparrow$. Given numbers $a$ and $b$, we can define $a \uparrow\uparrow b$ as $a^{a^{a^{...^{a}}}}$ which represents a tower of $b$ such $a$ values. For example, 

$$3 \uparrow\uparrow 2 = 3 \uparrow 3 = 3^{3} = 9$$

while 

$$ 3 \uparrow\uparrow 3 =  3 \uparrow 3 \uparrow 3 = 3^{3^{3}} = 3^{27} = 7,625,597,484,987$$

In a similar manner, 

$$ 3 \uparrow\uparrow 4 = 3 \uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow 3) = 3 \uparrow 7,625,597,484,987$$

or, in other words, an exponential tower of 3 values with more than **7.6 trillion** entries. Recalling 
that the number of particles in the observable universe is estimated at less than $10^{80}$, it should be
clear that we could never hope to write this value down in Arabic numerals, let alone at a rate fast enough
to outrun the heat death scenarios discussed earlier. 

Tetration is clearly an incredibly powerful operation, and yet, unbelievable as this may sound, it **still** 
isn't powerful enough to represent the current lower bound for BB(6). To do so, we need to use tetration
to define a more powerful operation called **pentation**, which will be represented as $\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow$.

Pentation is simply tetration repeated, just as tetration is repeated exponentiation. Given $a$ and $b$, we have

$$ a \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow b =
 \underbrace{a \uparrow\uparrow (a \uparrow\uparrow a \dots (a \uparrow\uparrow a))}_{\text{b copies}} $$

For example, 

$$ 3 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3 = 3 \uparrow\uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow 3)$$

and 

$$ 3 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = 3 \uparrow\uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow (3 \uparrow\uparrow 3))$$

To give an example which is still representable in scientific notation,

$$ 2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = 2 \uparrow\uparrow (2 \uparrow\uparrow (2 \uparrow\uparrow 2))$$

but $$ (2 \uparrow\uparrow 2) = 2^{2} = 4$$, so the above reduces to 

$$ 2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = 2 \uparrow\uparrow (2 \uparrow\uparrow 4)$$

We can reduce $2 \uparrow\uparrow 4$ to $ 2^{2^{2^{2}}}  = 2^{2^{4}} = 2^{16} = 65,536 $ 

so 

$$ 2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = 2^{65,536} \approx 10^{19,728} $$

Using pentation finally allows us to write down the new lower bound for BB(6), which is given as

$$ BB(6) > 2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 5 $$

which, using the preceding calculation for $2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4$, can be reduced to

$$ BB(6) > 2 \uparrow\uparrow (10^{19,700}) $$

Yes, just writing out all of the entries in this exponential tower would take far, far more particles than 
we could fit into our observable universe, to say nothing of evaluating it in Arabic numerals.

The great thing about Knuth's up-arrow notation is that it's immediately obvious how one can use a given
operation to construct a new, more powerful one, with no hard limits to how far one can take the process.
After pentation, we can define hexation, septation and so forth, even if we quickly run out of catchy names we can
give to the new operators.

To keep the number of arrows from getting too unwieldy, operators consisting of 4 or more up-arrows are usually
written in the form $a \uparrow^{n} b$, where the $n$ indicates the number of up-arrows we would normally write. 
For example, we can re-write $2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4$ as $2 \uparrow^{3} 4$, and 
$3 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3$ as $3 \uparrow^{4} 3$. This - naturally - opens up the door to yet another
round of recursiveness, as if we can have $3 \uparrow^{4} 3$, why not 

$$3 \uparrow^{3 \uparrow^{4} 3} 3$$ 

where the above expression uses an operator defined as having ${3 \uparrow^{4} 3}$ **up-arrows**. It may seem absurd
to wish to continue ratcheting up the power of the notation in this manner, but it does provide real mathematical value 
beyond just being entertaining for its own sake. Repeated application of this recursive technique was necessary to define
an upper bound for [Graham's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number), a value drawn from the mathematical
field of [Ramsey Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory). 

The upper bound for Graham's number has since been lowered considerably 
(to less than $2 \uparrow\uparrow (2 \uparrow\uparrow 5138)$ ), but the need for more powerful notational systems persists, 
even for mathematics which is easily comprehensible by a general audience. For example, it doesn't take much mathematical 
background to understand how Turing machines work and what the Busy Beaver problem is about, yet it's quite likely that
even the recursive extension of Knuth's up-arrow notation won't handle values like BB(10) and above. In a similar vein, the 
topic of [hydra games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_game) is easily accessible to laymen, yet the lower bounds 
for even relatively small [Kirby-Paris hydras](https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Kirby-Paris_hydra) are well beyond the notational power of Knuth's system. The [TREE function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem#TREE_function) has a relatively
elementary definition, but the numbers it generates are so much vaster than any mentioned on this page that it would take several more
articles like this one to gradually work up to understanding TREE(3). In short, all of this isn't just about building castles in
the sky for our own amusement.

I think a good way of thinking about the increasingly powerful notational systems I've discussed on here is to consider them as a form of technology, in the exact same way we consider calculators, phones, computers and the internet to be technologies. Just like all of the aforementioned physical technologies, more powerful notational systems enable more efficient ways of thinking about thing we already know a little (or even a lot) about, while opening up new approaches, and offering new fields for consideration. To the bureaucrats in Ur contemplating how much wheat groups of peasants owed their king, handling values in the millions and billions would have seemed a pointless indulgence, just as Roman administrators would have dismissed the utility of being to handle trillions with minimum ease. What  is commonly regarded as more than sufficient in each age eventually comes to seem woefully limited in another, and we deceive ourselves if we think we are exempt from this pattern.
